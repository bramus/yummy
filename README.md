DeliciousBackup Ñ Imports your del.icio.us bookmarks from a backup into a local database and lets you browse them

Now that there are rumors of [Delicious](http://del.icio.us/) being shut down / merged I found it necessary to keep my bookmarks safe and have a local, browsable copy of them.

This little app does exactly that: After [having created a backup of your bookmarks](https://secure.delicious.com/settings/bookmarks/export) `import.php` will import your bookmarks into a local database. Once imported `index.php` can take over and display them for you.

Feel free to fork off!
